# vpnGate
Free auto-maintain VPN service to surf the web.

The main reason I stopped developing this is because I lost some work which was offline and I got really pissed off, and also because I had to focus on another personal stuff.

So I am decided to finish this work as a proof of concept. I have started to document things (which I had not, very very bad). But if you got interested you can check the [tree-token](https://github.com/yanmarques/vpnGate/tree/tree-token) branch which is the latest one, notice that the file `lib/node.py` is missing because of wrong code base management, I am trying to get it better though. But you can check the tests  and the code at `blueprints/{blocks.py,landing.py}` to get an idea of what it does under the hood.

# Nice idea, but mainly impratical
## How it began?
I started developing this tool (I call this a tool based on this not being a simple program you run in your computer) because I was really concerned about my digital privacy and security. Firstly, as always, after a lot of research about the topic I was even more lost than before it. Anyways, when one paranoid person (like me) starts to wonder about too much thing that could happen, the focus is easily lost and the main reason is forgotten. This tool is the consequence of this process, besides I learned a lot ;)

## Things I learned
A lot. Actually more than I can put in words, but I will try to summarize some. 
I was always interested about security, dev-ops and that kind of stuff, but learn these by yourself was hard in the beggining. The time is gone and now after a few years of experience it kinda takes an automatically flow in my mind, this is not something you can learn in college, online courses, wathever...
Moving on, in the researchs I've made, I got to the conclusion that one can not (easily) have privacy AND security together, at least stronger ones. Generally, it is a choice one has to make.
